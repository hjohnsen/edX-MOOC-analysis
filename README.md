# edX-MOOC-analysis
Exploratory analysis of edX offerings from 2013-2016

# Overview
In this notebook, I explore a dataset containing data about MOOCs from edX. I start by doing a bit of exploratory data analysis to get a feel for what trends there might be. Next, I create graphs and plots to visualize those trends. I use a simple linear regression to associate words in the course subjects with the numbers of students pursuing certificates in those classes. I conclude with a discussion of limitations and a few ideas of questions that might be interesting to look at in the future.

This dataset is provided by Kaggle and describes the data from 4 years (2013-2016) of MOOC offerings on edX. edX is a platform for __M__assive __O__nline __O__pen __C__ourses, which now hosts courses from many universtities.
